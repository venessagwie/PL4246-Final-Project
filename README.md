# PL4246-Final-Project

Abstract: Previous research has revealed that social assimilation occurs within groups and homophilic choices can be intensified by clustering. Habitual physical activity can make use of these processes to influence individuals embedded in a social network to produce long-term well being.  An investigation to determine whether networks can have influencial properties to promote more active lifestyles was done using social network information, Moderate-to-Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA) and Physical Activity and Leisure Motivation Scale (PALMS) information obtained from a psychology class, PL4246: Networks in Psychology. Results showed that PL4246 students are marginally likely to be peers with those similar in extrinsic motivation and body-mind motives, presenting opportunities to enable connected student pairs to develop higher MVPA levels according to shared extrinsic motivation. Furthermore, results showed that students with lower MVPA duration tend to know and be connected to more individuals, demonstrating a likely possibility for popular, low MVPA students to be good hubs of information who can be a source of health-related and motivational information.
